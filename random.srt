1
00:00:03,193 --> 00:00:05,794
How do you explain the inexplicable?

2
00:00:06,230 --> 00:00:07,874
You don't.

3
00:00:07,898 --> 00:00:09,375
You just...

4
00:00:09,399 --> 00:00:11,444
surrender to it.

5
00:00:11,468 --> 00:00:12,734
You move on.

6
00:00:13,315 --> 00:00:15,290
Why? Because...

7
00:00:17,143 --> 00:00:19,143
...what other choice is there?

8
00:00:21,439 --> 00:00:23,017
The thing about Cable though,
if you knew her,

9
00:00:23,041 --> 00:00:24,107
you'd know...

10
00:00:26,311 --> 00:00:28,220
...she wasn't easy to move on from.

11
00:00:29,304 --> 00:00:31,180
She wasn't easy to quit.

12
00:00:32,683 --> 00:00:33,928
Take it from me. I hired her.

13
00:00:33,952 --> 00:00:36,197
I fired her. I hired her again.

14
00:00:37,956 --> 00:00:39,767
But, hey,

15
00:00:39,791 --> 00:00:42,903
Cable wouldn't want us to cry too hard

16
00:00:42,927 --> 00:00:44,905
or cry too long.

17
00:00:44,929 --> 00:00:47,575
She would want to know
that we all got together

18
00:00:47,599 --> 00:00:49,844
at her favorite hang,

19
00:00:50,325 --> 00:00:52,179
had a bunch of beers,

20
00:00:52,703 --> 00:00:53,914
put some...

21
00:00:54,444 --> 00:00:56,623
of her favorite songs on the jukebox...

22
00:00:58,750 --> 00:01:01,677
and remembered all those nutty T-shirts.

23
00:01:05,483 --> 00:01:06,861
To Cable.

24
00:01:06,885 --> 00:01:08,351
To Cable.

25
00:01:09,420 --> 00:01:11,999
If there's anything I can do,

26
00:01:12,023 --> 00:01:15,091
anything at all, don't hesitate to call.

27
00:01:20,932 --> 00:01:22,243
What?

28
00:01:22,267 --> 00:01:25,444
That's okay. I can have
my husband take care of it.

29
00:01:30,942 --> 00:01:33,368
The police called last night.

30
00:01:35,037 --> 00:01:39,193
They recovered some things from the car.

31
00:01:39,666 --> 00:01:41,061
From her...

32
00:01:41,418 --> 00:01:43,348
They said I could come
pick 'em up, but I...

33
00:01:43,372 --> 00:01:45,065
It's okay. We can do that.

34
00:01:45,089 --> 00:01:46,534
We'll take care of that.

35
00:01:46,558 --> 00:01:48,936
And then we can bring them to you.

36
00:01:49,551 --> 00:01:51,205
Or not.

37
00:01:51,678 --> 00:01:53,663
Whatever you decide.

38
00:01:54,799 --> 00:01:56,377
<i>Hey, Marissa, can you put</i>

39
00:01:56,401 --> 00:01:57,867
the TV on?

40
00:01:58,937 --> 00:02:00,414
Channel 3.

41
00:02:00,438 --> 00:02:02,149
And if you are just joining us,

42
00:02:02,173 --> 00:02:05,119
we have a late-breaking
development to tell you about.

43
00:02:05,143 --> 00:02:06,787
According to investigators,
they now believe

44
00:02:06,811 --> 00:02:09,456
a single member of the 40-person crew

45
00:02:09,480 --> 00:02:11,358
performing routine maintenance

46
00:02:11,382 --> 00:02:14,195
on this bridge less than three weeks ago

47
00:02:14,219 --> 00:02:16,130
embedded plastic explosives

48
00:02:16,154 --> 00:02:18,992
and a remote timer in one small section

49
00:02:19,016 --> 00:02:21,135
- of the bridge's undercarriage.
- That's the bridge that Cable...

50
00:02:21,159 --> 00:02:22,670
The question now is,

51
00:02:22,694 --> 00:02:24,471
if this wasn't a case
of infrastructure failure,

52
00:02:24,495 --> 00:02:26,307
but rather an act

53
00:02:26,331 --> 00:02:29,109
of sabotage, perhaps even an act
of terrorism,

54
00:02:29,133 --> 00:02:31,645
who was behind it and why?

55
00:02:31,669 --> 00:02:33,887
I don't have an answer, Ellen.

56
00:02:35,514 --> 00:02:38,052
It's a horrible world.

57
00:02:38,076 --> 00:02:40,120
We do unspeakable things to each other.

58
00:02:40,144 --> 00:02:41,388
I wish...

59
00:02:41,868 --> 00:02:43,772
I understood why.

60
00:02:44,883 --> 00:02:46,493
Absolutely.

61
00:02:46,922 --> 00:02:48,166
Whatever you need.

62
00:02:48,191 --> 00:02:49,235
Whatever the hour.

63
00:02:49,732 --> 00:02:50,831
I'm here.

64
00:02:50,855 --> 00:02:52,166
You call.

65
00:02:55,126 --> 00:02:57,438
I'm not gonna drop dead
from a sip of whiskey.

66
00:02:57,462 --> 00:02:58,439
You don't know that.

67
00:02:58,463 --> 00:02:59,974
I might kill you.

68
00:03:02,233 --> 00:03:04,078
- Did you tell him?
- He was on the phone.

69
00:03:04,102 --> 00:03:06,580
- Tell him what?
- They found the terrorists.

70
00:03:06,916 --> 00:03:08,382
Found the cell.

71
00:03:10,399 --> 00:03:11,719
Where? When?

72
00:03:11,743 --> 00:03:13,153
They were all killed.

73
00:03:13,676 --> 00:03:14,861
Somewhere in Prague.

74
00:03:15,762 --> 00:03:16,991
And according to reports,

75
00:03:17,015 --> 00:03:20,561
no one is taking credit for
the bridge collapse on purpose.

76
00:03:20,976 --> 00:03:23,228
They wanted to make it look
like an accident.

77
00:03:24,479 --> 00:03:27,268
They wanted to make us afraid of
everything we take for granted.

78
00:03:28,358 --> 00:03:29,603
During the raid, they found

79
00:03:29,627 --> 00:03:31,605
plans for, uh, 25 more...

80
00:03:31,629 --> 00:03:33,908
what did they call those... events.

81
00:03:33,932 --> 00:03:35,709
Now they're checking all over

82
00:03:35,733 --> 00:03:37,578
the country to make sure
that none of those

83
00:03:37,602 --> 00:03:39,101
were put into motion.

84
00:03:41,039 --> 00:03:42,883
So what do we do now?

85
00:03:43,540 --> 00:03:44,885
Nothing. Nothing.

86
00:03:44,909 --> 00:03:47,002
There's-there's nothing we can do.

87
00:03:48,211 --> 00:03:49,924
Leave here, we get in an elevator,

88
00:03:49,948 --> 00:03:52,426
we hope that no one has messed with it.

89
00:03:52,841 --> 00:03:55,384
We get on the subway,
and we hope that's safe, too.

90
00:04:01,850 --> 00:04:03,560
You know, they've won.

91
00:04:04,395 --> 00:04:06,907
They've taken that
certainty away from us.

92
00:04:07,439 --> 00:04:09,231
They've taken away our confidence.

93
00:04:12,170 --> 00:04:13,480
And they've taken Cable.

94
00:04:18,843 --> 00:04:20,776
Hello?

95
00:04:22,621 --> 00:04:23,872
Really?

96
00:04:25,499 --> 00:04:26,727
Sure.

97
00:04:26,751 --> 00:04:28,862
Send him up.

98
00:04:28,886 --> 00:04:30,364
Send who up?

99
00:04:30,388 --> 00:04:32,967
It's, like, 3:00 in the morning.

100
00:04:33,507 --> 00:04:35,803
I just kept thinking
about what Benny said.

101
00:04:36,718 --> 00:04:38,470
How there was nothing to do.

102
00:04:40,264 --> 00:04:42,509
Nothing to do but embrace fear.

103
00:04:51,900 --> 00:04:53,620
Time for breakfast?

104
00:04:53,644 --> 00:04:55,956
Eh, somewhere in the world.

105
00:04:55,980 --> 00:04:57,524
Sorry about the intrusion.

106
00:04:57,548 --> 00:04:59,482
No, you're not.

107
00:05:01,243 --> 00:05:03,203
Nice speech the other day.

108
00:05:04,704 --> 00:05:06,300
We haven't officially met.

109
00:05:06,324 --> 00:05:08,302
I'm Greg.

110
00:05:08,750 --> 00:05:10,270
I'm her husband.

111
00:05:10,710 --> 00:05:12,272
I'm Jason. I'm her...

112
00:05:12,296 --> 00:05:13,273
I know who you are.

113
00:05:13,297 --> 00:05:17,344
This midnight caller thing,

114
00:05:17,759 --> 00:05:19,179
you do this a lot?

115
00:05:19,203 --> 00:05:20,362
- No.
- Yes.

116
00:05:21,638 --> 00:05:23,484
You want something stronger than that?

117
00:05:23,508 --> 00:05:24,532
- No.
- Yes.

118
00:05:25,510 --> 00:05:27,488
<i>So, here's my question.</i>

119
00:05:28,145 --> 00:05:29,757
How do you do this?

120
00:05:30,063 --> 00:05:31,291
Plastic explosives.

121
00:05:31,315 --> 00:05:33,193
Remote timers. Passports.

122
00:05:33,217 --> 00:05:34,728
20-some other events. Training.

123
00:05:34,752 --> 00:05:35,996
It all costs money, right?

124
00:05:36,020 --> 00:05:37,398
I mean, you have to house people.

125
00:05:37,422 --> 00:05:38,866
You have to feed people.

126
00:05:38,890 --> 00:05:40,534
Okay...

127
00:05:40,558 --> 00:05:43,303
So... where does
all this money come from?

128
00:05:43,994 --> 00:05:46,640
Maybe a foreign government somewhere.

129
00:05:47,022 --> 00:05:48,199
Yeah.

130
00:05:48,665 --> 00:05:49,868
But how do you get it here?

131
00:05:49,892 --> 00:05:51,202
To America.

132
00:05:51,226 --> 00:05:53,872
How do you pay for all
this stuff, all these people?

133
00:05:53,896 --> 00:05:56,875
You need credit cards,
bank accounts, cash.

134
00:05:56,899 --> 00:05:59,593
Sounds like you need... a bank.

135
00:06:00,235 --> 00:06:01,813
Bingo.

136
00:06:01,837 --> 00:06:04,883
Marissa, you must know someone
at the U.S. attorney's office

137
00:06:04,907 --> 00:06:06,584
that specializes in terrorism.

138
00:06:06,608 --> 00:06:08,787
I do. But, Bull,
the terrorists are all dead.

139
00:06:08,811 --> 00:06:11,479
Who is it you're looking to go after?

140
00:06:12,981 --> 00:06:15,108
The folks that killed Cable.

141
00:06:15,984 --> 00:06:18,820
The folks who helped pay
for that bridge to come down.

142
00:06:19,288 --> 00:06:21,599
They bank with Thoreau Financial.

143
00:06:21,623 --> 00:06:25,069
A grand old 120-year-old American bank

144
00:06:25,093 --> 00:06:26,508
with branches all over the world.

145
00:06:27,261 --> 00:06:29,941
Your mom and dad probably had
a mortgage with them.

146
00:06:29,965 --> 00:06:31,743
So why aren't you guys
over there right now,

147
00:06:31,767 --> 00:06:34,245
guns blazing, throwing whoever's
allowing this to happen

148
00:06:34,269 --> 00:06:35,670
into prison?

149
00:06:36,271 --> 00:06:38,673
Well, we would if we could.

150
00:06:39,841 --> 00:06:42,620
Thoreau Financial was
actually investigated

151
00:06:42,644 --> 00:06:45,089
by the Senate Banking Committee in 2010.

152
00:06:45,113 --> 00:06:46,558
Then again in 2014.

153
00:06:46,582 --> 00:06:48,026
Then again last year.

154
00:06:48,050 --> 00:06:49,861
They were cleared of any wrongdoing

155
00:06:49,885 --> 00:06:51,689
each and every time.

156
00:06:51,713 --> 00:06:53,631
But how is that possible?

157
00:06:53,655 --> 00:06:57,235
You know, when my old
Homeland buddy Marissa called

158
00:06:57,259 --> 00:07:00,772
and asked me if I'd meet
with the great Jason Bull,

159
00:07:00,796 --> 00:07:04,642
I never would've guessed what
a babe in the woods you'd be.

160
00:07:04,666 --> 00:07:06,144
Was that meant to offend me?

161
00:07:06,168 --> 00:07:07,812
Never been called a babe before.

162
00:07:09,496 --> 00:07:11,649
Have you ever heard of John Honaker?

163
00:07:11,673 --> 00:07:14,118
He's the CEO of Thoreau.

164
00:07:14,142 --> 00:07:15,854
Basically, he<i> is</i> Thoreau.

165
00:07:15,878 --> 00:07:19,123
He bought it in 2008
after the financial crisis.

166
00:07:19,147 --> 00:07:21,860
He took a string of small
mom-and-pop community banks

167
00:07:21,884 --> 00:07:23,733
and he built it into
a multibillion dollar

168
00:07:23,757 --> 00:07:25,597
financial institution.

169
00:07:25,621 --> 00:07:27,765
No, you'll never get Thoreau.

170
00:07:27,789 --> 00:07:29,767
People have tried. I've tried.

171
00:07:29,791 --> 00:07:32,670
You bring down Thoreau Financial

172
00:07:32,694 --> 00:07:35,522
and the repercussions will
affect the entire economy.

173
00:07:36,231 --> 00:07:37,899
So that's that?

174
00:07:38,367 --> 00:07:40,300
That is that.

175
00:07:41,903 --> 00:07:43,548
What about that guy?

176
00:07:43,572 --> 00:07:44,883
What guy?

177
00:07:44,907 --> 00:07:46,317
The guy who runs it all.

178
00:07:46,341 --> 00:07:47,685
Honaker?

179
00:07:47,709 --> 00:07:49,954
- What if I just went after him?
<i>- This is</i>

180
00:07:49,978 --> 00:07:52,707
John Honaker, the CEO
of Thoreau Financial.

181
00:07:52,731 --> 00:07:55,326
This is what he had to say
on television this morning.

182
00:07:55,350 --> 00:07:57,896
All of us at Thoreau Financial
were shocked when we learned

183
00:07:57,920 --> 00:07:59,998
earlier today
that the terrorists responsible

184
00:08:00,022 --> 00:08:03,268
for that bridge collapse
apparently used our bank

185
00:08:03,292 --> 00:08:06,271
to facilitate their horrific activities.

186
00:08:06,295 --> 00:08:08,540
To be clear, we are in contact

187
00:08:08,564 --> 00:08:11,310
with Homeland Security, the CIA, the NSA,

188
00:08:11,334 --> 00:08:13,411
and both local and
international law enforcement.

189
00:08:13,435 --> 00:08:14,679
We're going to do everything we can

190
00:08:14,703 --> 00:08:15,916
to get to the bottom of this,

191
00:08:15,940 --> 00:08:19,117
to try and understand why
it happened, how it happened,

192
00:08:19,141 --> 00:08:21,719
and to make sure that nothing
like this ever happens again.

193
00:08:21,743 --> 00:08:24,389
In the meantime,
our prayers and sympathies

194
00:08:24,413 --> 00:08:26,239
are with the victims and their families.

195
00:08:27,082 --> 00:08:28,860
And according to Bull,

196
00:08:28,884 --> 00:08:30,368
he's our target.

197
00:08:32,981 --> 00:08:34,759
We're not prosecutors.

198
00:08:35,023 --> 00:08:37,001
We can't bring any criminal
charges against him.

199
00:08:37,025 --> 00:08:39,337
And as far as a civil lawsuit goes,

200
00:08:39,361 --> 00:08:41,940
we cannot sue on Cable's behalf.

201
00:08:41,964 --> 00:08:44,931
We are her employers, not her family.

202
00:08:46,101 --> 00:08:48,947
Seems like a fairly minor technicality.

203
00:08:53,461 --> 00:08:55,561
Oh, my goodness. Dr. Bull.

204
00:08:57,896 --> 00:08:59,272
How can I say no?

205
00:09:00,774 --> 00:09:02,400
Why would I say no?

206
00:09:03,719 --> 00:09:05,361
It might be painful.

207
00:09:07,242 --> 00:09:08,865
Reliving it again.

208
00:09:10,742 --> 00:09:13,536
I'll be filing the suit on your behalf,

209
00:09:14,730 --> 00:09:17,408
so you may have reporters
knocking on your door.

210
00:09:18,208 --> 00:09:19,844
As for court,

211
00:09:19,868 --> 00:09:21,248
you don't have to be there every day.

212
00:09:22,044 --> 00:09:23,588
I will pay for everything.

213
00:09:24,740 --> 00:09:25,965
Still...

214
00:09:27,884 --> 00:09:30,178
you might want to discuss it
with your husband.

215
00:09:34,883 --> 00:09:36,851
I love my husband.

216
00:09:38,086 --> 00:09:40,064
But, uh,

217
00:09:40,088 --> 00:09:42,065
he's not Cable's real father.

218
00:09:43,650 --> 00:09:45,985
And, frankly, this is my call.

219
00:09:49,364 --> 00:09:52,659
I don't suppose you've ever lost
a child, Dr. Bull.

220
00:09:58,206 --> 00:09:59,707
Make it hurt.

221
00:10:01,943 --> 00:10:05,143
I'm sure gonna try.

223
00:10:13,147 --> 00:10:14,558
Look at me.

224
00:10:14,582 --> 00:10:15,932
I'm looking.

225
00:10:16,484 --> 00:10:17,850
I'm not Cable.

226
00:10:17,851 --> 00:10:18,828
Thanks for that.

227
00:10:18,852 --> 00:10:20,263
The resemblance is startling.

228
00:10:20,287 --> 00:10:21,364
I'm an investigator.

229
00:10:21,388 --> 00:10:23,933
And this is not a case
that you learn on, Bull.

230
00:10:23,957 --> 00:10:26,102
This is a case that you-you go out

231
00:10:26,126 --> 00:10:27,536
and you get the very best po...

232
00:10:27,560 --> 00:10:29,171
I've got this.

233
00:10:29,195 --> 00:10:30,640
But he needs to hear that we...

234
00:10:30,664 --> 00:10:31,807
I've got this.

235
00:10:31,831 --> 00:10:32,975
Really.

236
00:10:32,999 --> 00:10:34,710
I've got this.

237
00:10:34,734 --> 00:10:35,912
See you in the morning.

238
00:10:38,438 --> 00:10:41,457
You see that pile of papers on
the left-hand side of your desk?

239
00:10:43,293 --> 00:10:45,264
Oh, my God, it's the Da Vinci Code.

240
00:10:45,289 --> 00:10:47,001
Who knew? It's been here the whole time?

241
00:10:47,025 --> 00:10:48,936
- I better call Tom Hanks.
- Those are résumés.

242
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:50,860
They have been here for three weeks.

243
00:10:52,690 --> 00:10:55,069
Okay, look, I don't want
to replace her, either.

244
00:10:55,466 --> 00:10:56,526
None of us do.

245
00:10:56,551 --> 00:10:59,740
It seems... callous and final,

246
00:10:59,765 --> 00:11:01,910
and I hate it, but if you want

247
00:11:01,935 --> 00:11:03,980
- to win this thing...
- Well, I can't do it.

248
00:11:04,908 --> 00:11:06,149
I can't...

249
00:11:07,444 --> 00:11:09,222
sit here with strangers

250
00:11:09,246 --> 00:11:11,543
and interview them and pretend
that I'm excited they're here.

251
00:11:11,567 --> 00:11:12,834
Well, then you don't get to pick.

252
00:11:12,858 --> 00:11:15,950
I'm getting someone
in here ASAP. I have to.

253
00:11:19,956 --> 00:11:21,434
I'm heading home.

254
00:11:21,458 --> 00:11:23,791
I will start to make calls
as soon as I get there.

255
00:11:24,561 --> 00:11:26,252
Then I'm going to bed.

256
00:11:27,964 --> 00:11:30,798
So... I'll see you tomorrow.

257
00:11:31,890 --> 00:11:33,212
What do you mean?

258
00:11:33,236 --> 00:11:36,658
Tomorrow? In the morning,
as opposed to later tonight?

259
00:11:36,682 --> 00:11:38,484
Oh, come on.

260
00:11:38,508 --> 00:11:40,019
That was fun.

261
00:11:40,043 --> 00:11:42,154
And yes, you'll see me in the morning

262
00:11:42,650 --> 00:11:44,690
and not before.

263
00:11:45,271 --> 00:11:47,293
- What are you gonna do?
- I'll just be here

264
00:11:47,317 --> 00:11:48,694
for a few more hours.

265
00:11:48,718 --> 00:11:51,564
Need to do a couple of miles
on the hamster wheel

266
00:11:51,588 --> 00:11:54,467
over there, and then start
learning everything I can

267
00:11:54,491 --> 00:11:56,954
about Honaker and his lawyer.

268
00:11:56,978 --> 00:11:58,230
Don't stay here too late.

269
00:11:58,254 --> 00:12:01,329
And, look... don't
fall asleep in your office.

270
00:12:02,165 --> 00:12:03,581
And don't drink.

271
00:12:04,237 --> 00:12:05,948
Can I at least have a few friends over,

272
00:12:05,972 --> 00:12:07,283
have a small party?

273
00:12:07,307 --> 00:12:09,352
I promise to clean up.
Dad said it was okay.

274
00:12:09,837 --> 00:12:11,220
Night, John-Boy.

275
00:12:11,244 --> 00:12:12,655
Night, Elizabeth.

276
00:12:33,133 --> 00:12:34,710
Hello?

277
00:12:40,473 --> 00:12:41,884
Hey!

278
00:12:41,908 --> 00:12:43,285
Oh, my gosh!

279
00:12:45,845 --> 00:12:47,390
You scared me.

280
00:12:47,414 --> 00:12:48,824
Sorry about the music.

281
00:12:48,848 --> 00:12:50,226
Helps me stay awake when I work.

282
00:12:50,250 --> 00:12:52,161
Oh, but I am so glad to see you.

283
00:12:52,185 --> 00:12:54,163
All these trash cans have food in them,

284
00:12:54,187 --> 00:12:56,098
And they're really starting to smell.

285
00:12:56,473 --> 00:12:57,466
Miss?

286
00:12:58,261 --> 00:13:00,069
Who the hell are you and how in the world

287
00:13:00,093 --> 00:13:01,570
did you get in here?

288
00:13:02,598 --> 00:13:05,474
Did they not tell you
someone was working tonight?

289
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:07,716
I'm supposed to be here.

290
00:13:07,740 --> 00:13:09,772
I promise. See? Credentials.

291
00:13:17,071 --> 00:13:18,254
You do not comport yourself

292
00:13:18,278 --> 00:13:20,823
like someone who does office maintenance.

293
00:13:20,847 --> 00:13:22,825
My name is Dr. Jason Bull.

294
00:13:22,849 --> 00:13:25,016
These<i> are</i> my offices.

295
00:13:26,286 --> 00:13:28,330
Oh, my gosh.

296
00:13:28,354 --> 00:13:30,332
You're him?

297
00:13:30,356 --> 00:13:32,334
Sh... ugar.

298
00:13:32,358 --> 00:13:33,755
I had no idea.

299
00:13:34,672 --> 00:13:36,705
These belong to Marissa Morgan.

300
00:13:36,729 --> 00:13:39,642
I know. She's the one who called me.

301
00:13:39,969 --> 00:13:41,277
I'm Taylor.

302
00:13:41,301 --> 00:13:42,445
Taylor Rentzel.

303
00:13:42,469 --> 00:13:44,447
She and I worked together at Homeland.

304
00:13:44,471 --> 00:13:47,683
She said you guys needed a bunch
of cyber-sleuthing done ASAP.

305
00:13:47,894 --> 00:13:49,885
And as it turns out, tonight's the night

306
00:13:49,909 --> 00:13:51,487
my three-year-old...

307
00:13:51,511 --> 00:13:54,323
goes to my ex for two days, so...

308
00:13:54,734 --> 00:13:57,126
Oh. Was that him on the phone?

309
00:13:57,570 --> 00:13:59,792
Child on the left, ex on the right.

310
00:14:00,381 --> 00:14:01,564
Mauricio.

311
00:14:02,241 --> 00:14:03,365
And moron.

312
00:14:03,389 --> 00:14:05,620
And Mauricio's very beautiful.

313
00:14:06,059 --> 00:14:09,972
Actually, uh, moron's
kind of pretty, too.

314
00:14:09,996 --> 00:14:12,559
This is Ivan Gronsky,
and as I'm sure you've read,

315
00:14:12,583 --> 00:14:14,477
he's the leader of the cell
that took down that bridge.

316
00:14:14,501 --> 00:14:18,013
Right. And he was killed along
with the rest of his cell

317
00:14:18,037 --> 00:14:20,182
during the CIA raid in Prague.

318
00:14:20,206 --> 00:14:21,784
- Right you are.
- Mm-hmm.

319
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:25,821
So why are we wasting our time
talking about a dead man?

320
00:14:25,845 --> 00:14:28,324
Because... at least the way
Marissa explained it to me...

321
00:14:28,348 --> 00:14:31,485
you're trying to prove
that this guy personally used

322
00:14:31,509 --> 00:14:32,862
his bank to launder money

323
00:14:32,886 --> 00:14:34,597
so the bad guys could do...

324
00:14:34,621 --> 00:14:35,898
bad things.

325
00:14:35,922 --> 00:14:37,933
That is the working theory, yes.

326
00:14:37,957 --> 00:14:40,102
So I've been looking
for points of intersection

327
00:14:40,126 --> 00:14:43,339
between this guy and anyone
connected with this cell.

328
00:14:43,363 --> 00:14:45,407
And by "points of
intersection," you mean...?

329
00:14:45,431 --> 00:14:47,409
Any time banker fellow
and anyone from the cell

330
00:14:47,433 --> 00:14:50,146
might have been at the same
place at the same time.

331
00:14:50,170 --> 00:14:51,213
Or, in this case,

332
00:14:51,237 --> 00:14:53,916
just on the same continent
at the same time.

333
00:14:53,940 --> 00:14:56,324
- Okay.
- And as it happens,

334
00:14:56,348 --> 00:14:57,853
for about a six-month period,

335
00:14:57,877 --> 00:15:00,745
Mr. Gronsky lived in America.

336
00:15:01,881 --> 00:15:04,860
Really? And what was he doing here?

337
00:15:04,884 --> 00:15:07,530
He spent a semester
at an Ivy League school.

338
00:15:07,932 --> 00:15:09,031
Do tell.

339
00:15:09,055 --> 00:15:11,567
And guess who else
attended the same school,

340
00:15:11,591 --> 00:15:13,724
three years ahead but at the same time?

341
00:15:15,133 --> 00:15:16,600
Scrooge McDuck.

342
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,238
Thank you for doing this.

343
00:15:23,669 --> 00:15:25,981
I'm sorry I frightened you before.

344
00:15:26,005 --> 00:15:27,483
I'm going to leave you now,

345
00:15:27,507 --> 00:15:29,551
so you can dance, dance, dance.

346
00:15:30,152 --> 00:15:31,654
And you're hired, by the way.

347
00:15:31,678 --> 00:15:32,988
Did Marissa already talk money or...

348
00:15:33,012 --> 00:15:34,890
Rein it in there, big guy.

349
00:15:34,914 --> 00:15:37,159
I'm not hired,
because I already have a job.

350
00:15:37,183 --> 00:15:38,827
I work for Homeland Security.

351
00:15:38,851 --> 00:15:40,829
Specialize in international banking.

352
00:15:40,853 --> 00:15:42,923
And, uh, there is no pay,

353
00:15:42,947 --> 00:15:44,900
because I'm not allowed
to do this if there is.

354
00:15:44,924 --> 00:15:46,302
Homeland policy.

355
00:15:46,326 --> 00:15:48,971
This is a favor for my friend Marissa.

356
00:15:49,557 --> 00:15:51,173
And it's just for two days.

357
00:15:51,197 --> 00:15:52,474
Hmm.

358
00:15:52,498 --> 00:15:54,577
But it was a pleasure to meet you.

359
00:15:54,601 --> 00:15:55,945
A pleasure to be met.

360
00:15:55,969 --> 00:15:58,080
And again, thank you...

361
00:15:58,524 --> 00:16:00,349
so much.

362
00:16:00,818 --> 00:16:02,540
Anytime.

363
00:16:12,819 --> 00:16:15,130
Can I help? He worked late.

364
00:16:15,154 --> 00:16:17,866
Yeah. Well, I... just got a love letter

365
00:16:17,890 --> 00:16:19,702
from Thoreau Financial.

366
00:16:19,726 --> 00:16:21,370
Motion to dismiss.

367
00:16:21,394 --> 00:16:23,906
<i>Ms. George,</i> I read
your motion to dismiss,

368
00:16:23,930 --> 00:16:26,442
all 220 pages of it.

369
00:16:26,466 --> 00:16:28,811
If I could trouble you
to restate your argument...

370
00:16:28,835 --> 00:16:31,780
briefly... as to why
I should dismiss this case?

371
00:16:31,804 --> 00:16:33,349
Thank you, Your Honor.

372
00:16:33,373 --> 00:16:35,117
And let me begin by saying

373
00:16:35,141 --> 00:16:37,553
that our hearts go out to the victims

374
00:16:37,577 --> 00:16:40,942
of the I-99 Bridge collapse
and to their families.

375
00:16:41,375 --> 00:16:43,158
But while we grieve for the victims,

376
00:16:43,182 --> 00:16:45,561
we take strong exception to the assertion

377
00:16:45,585 --> 00:16:47,696
that Mr. Honaker is somehow involved

378
00:16:47,720 --> 00:16:49,098
or personally responsible.

379
00:16:49,122 --> 00:16:51,133
And given the complete lack of evidence

380
00:16:51,157 --> 00:16:53,802
to support such an outrageous assertion,

381
00:16:53,826 --> 00:16:56,505
dismissal seems like
the only just course of action.

382
00:16:57,333 --> 00:16:59,174
Mr. Colón,
you haven't presented the court

383
00:16:59,198 --> 00:17:00,643
with much information.

384
00:17:00,667 --> 00:17:02,678
Yes, we know that, Your Honor.

385
00:17:02,702 --> 00:17:05,948
Unfortunately, all of the
relevant transactional records

386
00:17:05,972 --> 00:17:08,484
are in the possession
of Thoreau Financial.

387
00:17:08,508 --> 00:17:11,640
All we're asking for is a chance
to examine their records.

388
00:17:11,664 --> 00:17:14,757
Which is the very definition
of a fishing expedition.

389
00:17:14,781 --> 00:17:16,859
Ooh, there's nothing wrong with fishing.

390
00:17:16,883 --> 00:17:19,161
Sometimes you hook a marlin.

391
00:17:19,185 --> 00:17:20,959
What are you afraid of, Ms. George?

392
00:17:20,983 --> 00:17:22,331
Mr. Colón.

393
00:17:22,858 --> 00:17:23,932
Your Honor,

394
00:17:23,956 --> 00:17:25,901
terrorists have struck our soil.

395
00:17:26,362 --> 00:17:29,838
37 people are dead,
including my client's daughter.

396
00:17:30,574 --> 00:17:32,395
All of the victim's families...

397
00:17:32,419 --> 00:17:34,664
every American, for that matter...

398
00:17:34,688 --> 00:17:36,832
is entitled to transparency.

399
00:17:36,856 --> 00:17:38,624
They're entitled to the truth.

400
00:17:39,959 --> 00:17:42,026
Motion to dismiss denied.

401
00:17:43,150 --> 00:17:46,242
- Thank you, Your Honor.
- But barely. I'm allowing this

402
00:17:46,266 --> 00:17:48,360
to go to trial, but if you don't
come up with more than this,

403
00:17:48,384 --> 00:17:50,206
I won't hesitate to pull the plug.

404
00:17:50,230 --> 00:17:52,214
Ms. George, I'm ordering you

405
00:17:52,238 --> 00:17:54,604
to comply with the plaintiff's
discovery requests.

406
00:18:10,356 --> 00:18:13,002
They're trying to paper us
into submission.

407
00:18:13,026 --> 00:18:15,201
Yeah. I can see exactly
what they're doing.

408
00:18:15,225 --> 00:18:17,440
400,000 pages of transactions,

409
00:18:17,464 --> 00:18:19,715
250 million routing records.

410
00:18:19,716 --> 00:18:20,826
Every time little Timmy got

411
00:18:20,850 --> 00:18:22,461
a ten dollar birthday
check from his nana,

412
00:18:22,485 --> 00:18:23,529
it's in there.

413
00:18:23,553 --> 00:18:24,864
Hmm. Can you call them

414
00:18:24,888 --> 00:18:26,599
and thank them
for their exceptional response

415
00:18:26,623 --> 00:18:29,101
to our request,
but see if they couldn't send us

416
00:18:29,125 --> 00:18:30,202
their digital files?

417
00:18:30,226 --> 00:18:32,004
Now that we have a new Cable.

418
00:18:32,028 --> 00:18:34,629
- We have a new Cable?
- We have a temporary Taylor.

419
00:18:38,392 --> 00:18:40,613
Mrs. McCrory.

420
00:18:40,637 --> 00:18:42,448
Ellen.

421
00:18:42,472 --> 00:18:44,383
What's that expression?

422
00:18:44,407 --> 00:18:47,787
"If it looks like a duck
and quacks like a duck,

423
00:18:47,811 --> 00:18:50,856
then it's probably a duck"?

424
00:18:51,238 --> 00:18:53,381
Sorry, you lost me at the first duck.

425
00:18:55,051 --> 00:18:58,764
A man came to my home early this morning.

426
00:18:59,330 --> 00:19:01,734
He knocked on my door.

427
00:19:01,758 --> 00:19:04,403
He would not explicitly identify himself

428
00:19:04,427 --> 00:19:06,939
as working for Thoreau or Mr. Honaker,

429
00:19:06,963 --> 00:19:09,942
but he did let me know
in no uncertain terms

430
00:19:09,966 --> 00:19:14,313
that a $10 million settlement
was not out of the question

431
00:19:14,337 --> 00:19:18,184
if... I were to drop my lawsuit.

432
00:19:18,891 --> 00:19:20,508
What'd you say?

433
00:19:21,644 --> 00:19:23,729
I told him to go duck himself.

434
00:19:24,113 --> 00:19:25,724
You okay?

435
00:19:27,150 --> 00:19:28,776
Kind of pleased, actually.

436
00:19:29,452 --> 00:19:32,798
I mean, th-they're basically
admitting they did it,

437
00:19:33,322 --> 00:19:35,134
aren't they?

438
00:19:35,158 --> 00:19:37,736
If you give somebody money like that,

439
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:40,172
try to get them to go away...

440
00:19:40,196 --> 00:19:42,096
That's exactly what it means.

441
00:19:43,199 --> 00:19:45,044
We're making progress.

442
00:19:45,068 --> 00:19:46,846
Yeah.

443
00:19:46,870 --> 00:19:49,136
But we haven't made it hurt yet.

444
00:19:51,580 --> 00:19:53,834
This trial's about banking and coding

445
00:19:53,859 --> 00:19:55,069
and transactions and details.

446
00:19:55,093 --> 00:19:57,071
We need people who are
gonna be able to absorb

447
00:19:57,095 --> 00:19:59,073
bits of minutiae and not be overwhelmed.

448
00:19:59,097 --> 00:20:00,842
Which means Honaker's lawyers

449
00:20:00,866 --> 00:20:02,377
will be looking for the opposite...

450
00:20:02,401 --> 00:20:04,012
jurors with short attention spans.

451
00:20:04,036 --> 00:20:07,081
People who, when confronted
with the enormity

452
00:20:07,105 --> 00:20:09,984
of complicated evidence, will tune out.

453
00:20:10,008 --> 00:20:12,787
Do you own a smartphone, sir?

454
00:20:12,811 --> 00:20:14,255
It's a phone.

455
00:20:14,822 --> 00:20:17,959
Okay. And has anyone ever
texted you a photo on it?

456
00:20:17,983 --> 00:20:20,028
Yeah. I-I think.

457
00:20:20,052 --> 00:20:22,530
All right. Well,
let's just assume someone has,

458
00:20:22,554 --> 00:20:25,567
and let's assume that you
wanted to share that photo

459
00:20:25,591 --> 00:20:27,001
with juror number eight.

460
00:20:27,025 --> 00:20:29,971
Can you take me through
the steps involved

461
00:20:29,995 --> 00:20:32,629
for you to re-text that photo?

462
00:20:34,405 --> 00:20:35,771
No.

463
00:20:36,735 --> 00:20:38,913
You touch the picture,
and you drag it to his phone.

464
00:20:38,937 --> 00:20:40,148
And how do you do that?

465
00:20:40,172 --> 00:20:44,018
You just... you just drag it
as hard as you can.

466
00:20:44,042 --> 00:20:45,353
<i>You touch it,</i>

467
00:20:45,377 --> 00:20:47,655
the picture or the text message
you're trying to send.

468
00:20:47,679 --> 00:20:49,531
That highlights it.
Once it's highlighted,

469
00:20:49,555 --> 00:20:51,357
an icon will appear with the arrow.

470
00:20:51,381 --> 00:20:53,503
You highlight that, and a dialogue box

471
00:20:53,527 --> 00:20:56,331
will appear asking for the phone
number you want to text to.

472
00:20:56,355 --> 00:20:59,422
You enter the phone number,
and you press send.

473
00:21:02,947 --> 00:21:04,005
Okay.

474
00:21:04,029 --> 00:21:05,240
I've got a riddle.

475
00:21:05,264 --> 00:21:06,574
Your Honor...

476
00:21:06,598 --> 00:21:07,775
I like riddles.

477
00:21:07,799 --> 00:21:09,244
Thank you, Your Honor.

478
00:21:09,268 --> 00:21:12,947
Now, a man has a fox, a duck,

479
00:21:12,971 --> 00:21:14,582
and a bag of beans.

480
00:21:14,606 --> 00:21:17,018
And he has to get them across the river,

481
00:21:17,042 --> 00:21:18,553
but he can only take one at a time.

482
00:21:18,577 --> 00:21:20,855
Now, if he leaves the fox with the duck,

483
00:21:20,879 --> 00:21:22,090
the fox will eat the duck.

484
00:21:22,114 --> 00:21:23,625
If he leaves the duck with the beans,

485
00:21:23,649 --> 00:21:25,593
the duck will eat the beans.

486
00:21:25,617 --> 00:21:27,017
How is he...?

487
00:21:28,954 --> 00:21:30,632
I'm getting rid of all of them.

488
00:21:30,656 --> 00:21:32,700
Wait, why? They know the answer.

489
00:21:32,724 --> 00:21:35,737
No. They just think they do.
There is no answer.

490
00:21:40,213 --> 00:21:42,910
So, here's the good news.
You have a case.

491
00:21:42,934 --> 00:21:45,747
The bad news is
it's a circumstantial case.

492
00:21:45,771 --> 00:21:47,915
We've won with circumstantial.

493
00:21:47,939 --> 00:21:49,751
Well, you won't win with this one.

494
00:21:49,775 --> 00:21:51,552
The terrorist accounts
should have been red-flagged

495
00:21:51,576 --> 00:21:53,674
by the bank's own
internal auditing system,

496
00:21:53,698 --> 00:21:54,874
and they weren't.

497
00:21:54,898 --> 00:21:55,990
A problem with the program?

498
00:21:56,014 --> 00:21:57,592
I'm sure that's what
they want you to think.

499
00:21:57,616 --> 00:22:00,628
But then I found 71
other suspicious activity alerts

500
00:22:00,652 --> 00:22:02,797
that the bank was all over, immediately.

501
00:22:02,821 --> 00:22:03,965
But not Gronsky's.

502
00:22:03,989 --> 00:22:06,334
- Not Gronsky's.
- You find any

503
00:22:06,358 --> 00:22:08,336
direct connection between
Honaker and the terrorist?

504
00:22:08,360 --> 00:22:10,371
Now that you mention it,

505
00:22:10,395 --> 00:22:13,241
apparently Honaker was in Panama
with a group of bankers

506
00:22:13,265 --> 00:22:15,109
two days after that bridge came down.

507
00:22:15,133 --> 00:22:17,600
And that matters because...?

508
00:22:19,154 --> 00:22:21,349
I cheated. I ran an NSA check.

509
00:22:21,782 --> 00:22:24,250
Gronsky was off the grid at that time,

510
00:22:24,274 --> 00:22:27,155
and the soft intel suggests
he was probably in Panama.

511
00:22:27,179 --> 00:22:28,489
That's really great.

512
00:22:28,513 --> 00:22:30,281
But it's still not conclusive.

513
00:22:30,305 --> 00:22:31,559
We made a point to pick a jury

514
00:22:31,583 --> 00:22:32,994
that would pay attention to the details,

515
00:22:33,018 --> 00:22:35,957
follow a fact pattern,
not leap to conclusions.

516
00:22:35,981 --> 00:22:38,110
We really need proof.

517
00:22:38,134 --> 00:22:39,334
Hard proof.

518
00:22:40,134 --> 00:22:41,969
Sorry to eat and run. My day care closes

519
00:22:41,993 --> 00:22:44,279
in 25 minutes. I'll be in early tomorrow.

520
00:22:44,303 --> 00:22:46,203
7:30-ish. Nice to meet you, Danny,

521
00:22:46,227 --> 00:22:47,675
Benny, Chuck.

522
00:22:47,699 --> 00:22:49,777
Chunk.

523
00:22:51,107 --> 00:22:53,652
Well, other than screwing up
my name, she's very impressive.

524
00:22:53,677 --> 00:22:54,988
Yeah, nice work, Marissa.

525
00:22:55,012 --> 00:22:56,956
Well, we only have her for one more day,

526
00:22:56,980 --> 00:22:58,747
so let's use her while we can.

527
00:22:59,723 --> 00:23:01,768
Anything else on the investigative front?

528
00:23:02,219 --> 00:23:04,364
Yeah, I've got something.
So, I've been tracking down

529
00:23:04,388 --> 00:23:06,733
former employees who might
be able to shed some light

530
00:23:06,757 --> 00:23:08,201
on Honaker and Thoreau,

531
00:23:08,225 --> 00:23:10,103
and I found this independent contractor

532
00:23:10,127 --> 00:23:12,706
who was hired to write
banking code for Thoreau.

533
00:23:12,730 --> 00:23:16,309
His specialty is defeating
governmental safeguard systems.

534
00:23:16,333 --> 00:23:17,343
Bingo.

535
00:23:17,367 --> 00:23:19,579
- You think he'll talk to us?
- Well,

536
00:23:19,603 --> 00:23:20,947
everyone I've approached

537
00:23:20,971 --> 00:23:22,215
with any connection to the company

538
00:23:22,239 --> 00:23:24,684
is either afraid to speak
or has signed an NDA.

539
00:23:24,708 --> 00:23:27,120
Including this guy, Adam Shaw.

540
00:23:27,144 --> 00:23:28,588
I-I don't get it.

541
00:23:28,612 --> 00:23:31,024
If he won't speak to us...
if he<i> can't</i> speak to us...

542
00:23:31,048 --> 00:23:33,993
Well, the thing is, uh, he's dying.

543
00:23:34,017 --> 00:23:35,895
Stage IV lymphoma.

544
00:23:35,919 --> 00:23:37,897
Well, nothing to lose.

545
00:23:37,921 --> 00:23:40,088
Chuck, bring him in. Do your magic.

546
00:23:43,427 --> 00:23:45,972
I know you had me served with a subpoena,

547
00:23:45,996 --> 00:23:49,776
but I'm honestly not sure
I can be of any help to you.

548
00:23:49,800 --> 00:23:51,778
I only worked at Thoreau for nine months.

549
00:23:51,802 --> 00:23:54,848
Oh, let me be the judge
of that, Mr. Shaw.

550
00:23:54,872 --> 00:23:57,550
- So, you write code?
- When I'm well enough

551
00:23:57,574 --> 00:24:00,954
to work, which is not
terribly often these days.

552
00:24:00,978 --> 00:24:02,341
I'm sorry.

553
00:24:02,780 --> 00:24:05,058
Can I ask you about John Honaker?

554
00:24:05,082 --> 00:24:06,595
About Thoreau Financial?

555
00:24:08,806 --> 00:24:11,865
Y-You know I'm-I'm not supposed
to tell you anything.

556
00:24:11,889 --> 00:24:14,365
You know they made me sign an NDA.

557
00:24:14,389 --> 00:24:16,469
Yeah, but...

558
00:24:16,493 --> 00:24:19,806
I know you know there are 37 people dead.

559
00:24:19,830 --> 00:24:23,665
And a lot of times, that changes things.

560
00:24:25,777 --> 00:24:29,315
Mr. Shaw, how did you come to apply

561
00:24:29,339 --> 00:24:30,950
for a job at Thoreau?

562
00:24:31,412 --> 00:24:32,786
I-I didn't apply

563
00:24:32,810 --> 00:24:35,054
for the job. They-they sought me out.

564
00:24:35,078 --> 00:24:36,589
And when you say "they"...?

565
00:24:36,613 --> 00:24:40,093
I was... I was hired directly
by Mr. Honaker.

566
00:24:40,117 --> 00:24:42,562
He seemed to know exactly who I was

567
00:24:42,586 --> 00:24:43,895
and exactly what I did.

568
00:24:43,919 --> 00:24:47,243
And this was shortly after
the terrorist Ivan Gronsky

569
00:24:47,267 --> 00:24:49,402
opened up his accounts at Thoreau?

570
00:24:49,426 --> 00:24:51,640
- That's correct.
- And at that time,

571
00:24:51,664 --> 00:24:56,109
did Mr. Honaker explain
to you exactly what he wanted?

572
00:24:56,133 --> 00:24:58,178
He couldn't have been more specific.

573
00:24:58,202 --> 00:25:01,648
Uh, my first assignment
was to create a backdoor code.

574
00:25:01,672 --> 00:25:03,917
And for those of us
who don't speak computer,

575
00:25:03,941 --> 00:25:05,485
what is a backdoor code?

576
00:25:05,509 --> 00:25:08,688
I-It's a type of bypass key.

577
00:25:08,712 --> 00:25:11,991
Um, it's a piece of code
created specifically

578
00:25:12,015 --> 00:25:15,161
to work around the regulatory protocols

579
00:25:15,185 --> 00:25:17,063
set up by the U.S. government

580
00:25:17,087 --> 00:25:20,856
to detect suspicious transactions.

581
00:25:22,158 --> 00:25:23,847
Everybody following along?

582
00:25:23,871 --> 00:25:25,972
They're hanging on his every word.

583
00:25:25,996 --> 00:25:27,841
That must have raised
some concerns for you.

584
00:25:27,865 --> 00:25:30,210
I mean, the president

585
00:25:30,234 --> 00:25:33,680
of a bank asks you to
create some software

586
00:25:33,704 --> 00:25:36,282
so that he can defeat
government safeguards.

587
00:25:36,306 --> 00:25:37,684
I mean...

588
00:25:37,708 --> 00:25:40,486
yes and no. I guess it should have.

589
00:25:40,510 --> 00:25:44,324
The truth is
that I didn't specifically know

590
00:25:44,348 --> 00:25:46,392
what they were going to use the code for.

591
00:25:46,416 --> 00:25:50,563
Sometimes banks keep it
as a... fail-safe.

592
00:25:50,587 --> 00:25:53,499
They know a transaction is good,
and they don't want

593
00:25:53,523 --> 00:25:57,303
the government freezing it
or flagging it.

594
00:25:57,327 --> 00:25:59,339
I mean, I didn't

595
00:25:59,363 --> 00:26:03,076
specifically know
that Thoreau was going to use it

596
00:26:03,100 --> 00:26:06,913
to thwart the AML or KYC protocols.

597
00:26:07,424 --> 00:26:09,749
Again, a little help, sir.

598
00:26:09,773 --> 00:26:13,620
AML are anti-money laundering programs.

599
00:26:13,644 --> 00:26:16,222
KYC stands for "know your clients."

600
00:26:16,246 --> 00:26:20,526
Uh, every bank is required to have them.

601
00:26:20,550 --> 00:26:23,296
Okay, so you create this code.

602
00:26:23,320 --> 00:26:27,166
And how did you come to realize
that it was being abused?

603
00:26:27,190 --> 00:26:30,370
I take pride in my work.
I would dip into the system

604
00:26:30,394 --> 00:26:33,573
and monitor it from time to time
just to make sure

605
00:26:33,597 --> 00:26:36,276
that there wasn't anything going wrong.

606
00:26:36,300 --> 00:26:39,078
Just to get ahead
of any potential problems.

607
00:26:39,102 --> 00:26:40,914
And that's how you became aware

608
00:26:40,938 --> 00:26:43,549
of what the bank
was really doing with the code.

609
00:26:43,573 --> 00:26:46,365
Yeah. And I reported it immediately.

610
00:26:46,389 --> 00:26:47,943
Who did you report it to?

611
00:26:50,147 --> 00:26:53,136
Hey, Mr. Shaw, it's okay.

612
00:26:55,585 --> 00:26:58,131
To him. To John Honaker.

613
00:26:59,556 --> 00:27:00,733
Things are getting

614
00:27:00,757 --> 00:27:02,770
really green with our mirror jury.

615
00:27:02,794 --> 00:27:05,038
The real one's buying it, too.

616
00:27:05,983 --> 00:27:09,309
You realize that you're breaking your NDA

617
00:27:09,333 --> 00:27:12,111
- by testifying with us today?
- Of course.

618
00:27:12,656 --> 00:27:14,480
But I'm dying.

619
00:27:14,504 --> 00:27:17,661
What are they gonna do to me?

620
00:27:18,141 --> 00:27:19,852
- Nice work, Counselor.
- Thank you.

621
00:27:19,876 --> 00:27:23,990
By any chance would
you gentlemen be free right now?

622
00:27:24,014 --> 00:27:27,927
For you? Never free. Always available.

623
00:27:28,505 --> 00:27:29,884
My offices.

624
00:27:34,658 --> 00:27:36,402
It's a shame we didn't have a towel.

625
00:27:36,426 --> 00:27:38,271
We could have handed it
to her here and now

626
00:27:38,295 --> 00:27:39,600
so she could throw it in.

627
00:27:40,831 --> 00:27:42,709
Have Marissa call Cable's mother.

628
00:27:42,733 --> 00:27:44,777
Put her on high alert
to come to court tomorrow.

629
00:27:44,801 --> 00:27:45,934
Will do.

630
00:27:49,489 --> 00:27:50,933
You understand this is a nuisance case

631
00:27:50,957 --> 00:27:53,135
for my bank. Period.

632
00:27:53,159 --> 00:27:56,372
It's bad PR, but PR is highly perishable.

633
00:27:56,396 --> 00:27:58,574
All it takes is a couple
of news cycles and...

634
00:27:58,598 --> 00:28:00,109
What's it doing for your stock price?

635
00:28:00,537 --> 00:28:02,011
How many shares
does he personally control?

636
00:28:02,035 --> 00:28:03,846
- 15 million.
- Ooh.

637
00:28:03,870 --> 00:28:05,414
And every dollar it goes down...

638
00:28:05,438 --> 00:28:06,716
If you're suggesting that I put

639
00:28:06,740 --> 00:28:08,417
my personal net worth over
the safety of others...

640
00:28:08,441 --> 00:28:09,552
That's not for us to decide.

641
00:28:09,576 --> 00:28:11,256
We're comfortable leaving it to the jury.

642
00:28:12,612 --> 00:28:16,559
We'll pay your client
$25 million to settle.

643
00:28:16,583 --> 00:28:19,829
Obviously, I'm obliged to share
your offer with my client,

644
00:28:19,853 --> 00:28:22,131
but I will strongly advise her
to reject it.

645
00:28:22,155 --> 00:28:25,167
If you'll excuse me, have a
moment with my partner here.

646
00:28:25,191 --> 00:28:27,336
And she does tend to take my advice.

647
00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:29,138
I'm trying to be reasonable here.

648
00:28:29,566 --> 00:28:31,240
I'm trying to put this all behind us.

649
00:28:31,264 --> 00:28:33,278
Oh, well...

650
00:28:34,404 --> 00:28:36,245
what do you know, it's not there.

651
00:28:36,269 --> 00:28:37,880
What do you want?

652
00:28:38,283 --> 00:28:39,782
I want him to hurt.

653
00:28:40,285 --> 00:28:41,717
The way my client is gonna hurt

654
00:28:41,741 --> 00:28:44,520
every time she walks
by her daughter's bedroom.

655
00:28:45,123 --> 00:28:47,211
The way those families are hurting.

656
00:28:58,053 --> 00:29:01,237
Mr. Colón, any idea why your witness

657
00:29:01,261 --> 00:29:03,639
has chosen not to grace us
with his presence?

658
00:29:03,663 --> 00:29:06,742
Uh, Your Honor, I know
that Mr. Shaw was most anxious

659
00:29:06,766 --> 00:29:08,277
to be cross-examined,

660
00:29:08,301 --> 00:29:10,546
and I know that with his illness,

661
00:29:10,570 --> 00:29:12,348
mobility can sometimes be an issue.

662
00:29:12,372 --> 00:29:14,150
We expect him any minute now.

663
00:29:14,174 --> 00:29:15,785
I will give him another three minutes.

664
00:29:15,809 --> 00:29:17,447
Yes, Your Honor.

665
00:29:25,664 --> 00:29:27,096
Talk to me.

666
00:29:27,541 --> 00:29:28,764
He's dead.

667
00:29:29,126 --> 00:29:31,403
- What?
- I went to his apartment to pick him up,

668
00:29:31,427 --> 00:29:33,766
and the ambulance
was already there. EMTs.

669
00:29:33,790 --> 00:29:35,237
The cleaning lady found him.

670
00:29:35,261 --> 00:29:38,507
Mr. Colón? Dr. Bull?

671
00:29:38,531 --> 00:29:40,882
So, the judge gave us

672
00:29:40,906 --> 00:29:43,245
a continuance until tomorrow.

673
00:29:43,269 --> 00:29:45,614
He's also giving the
jury a stern instruction

674
00:29:45,638 --> 00:29:47,817
to disregard all of Shaw's testimony.

675
00:29:48,186 --> 00:29:49,518
Well, there you have it.

676
00:29:50,188 --> 00:29:53,088
Can I ask a really horrible question?

677
00:29:53,567 --> 00:29:55,691
Does anyone think it's just a coincidence

678
00:29:55,715 --> 00:29:57,993
that that poor man
was found dead this morning?

679
00:29:58,405 --> 00:30:00,396
For what it's worth,
everyone at the scene

680
00:30:00,420 --> 00:30:02,097
believed they were looking
at natural causes.

681
00:30:02,121 --> 00:30:04,166
There wasn't even a hint
of anything criminal.

682
00:30:04,744 --> 00:30:06,635
From your lips.

683
00:30:07,372 --> 00:30:09,227
Knock, knock.

684
00:30:12,460 --> 00:30:13,865
What you thinking, Lincoln?

685
00:30:16,069 --> 00:30:17,841
Someone looks unhappy.

686
00:30:18,538 --> 00:30:20,983
I thought we were finished with you.

687
00:30:21,553 --> 00:30:22,985
How'd you get in here?

688
00:30:23,889 --> 00:30:26,088
I was over at Homeland,
and I stumbled across something

689
00:30:26,112 --> 00:30:27,756
I thought you might find interesting.

690
00:30:27,780 --> 00:30:29,772
Told Marissa all about it and...

691
00:30:29,796 --> 00:30:31,393
And she gave you her credentials.

692
00:30:31,417 --> 00:30:32,795
Doesn't she know that goes
on your permanent record?

693
00:30:32,819 --> 00:30:36,232
Doesn't she know she's not gonna
get into a good college now?

694
00:30:36,860 --> 00:30:38,528
Why do you look so sad?

695
00:30:40,491 --> 00:30:43,625
Our key witness,
a whistleblower Danny found,

696
00:30:44,451 --> 00:30:47,576
suddenly died before he could
complete his testimony.

697
00:30:48,955 --> 00:30:50,045
I'm sorry.

698
00:30:50,457 --> 00:30:52,375
Pulmonary embolism.

699
00:30:54,294 --> 00:30:56,719
I had one of those a few months ago.

700
00:30:56,743 --> 00:30:58,420
I heard.

701
00:30:58,444 --> 00:31:01,156
Fun fact: if you want to poison somebody,

702
00:31:01,180 --> 00:31:03,337
always choose potassium chloride.

703
00:31:03,361 --> 00:31:07,451
Leaves no trace and presents
as pulmonary embolism.

704
00:31:08,981 --> 00:31:10,310
Oh, my God.

705
00:31:11,561 --> 00:31:13,469
This guy Honaker helped kill Cable.

706
00:31:13,493 --> 00:31:15,037
I'm pretty sure he killed my witness.

707
00:31:15,061 --> 00:31:17,273
And it looks like...

708
00:31:17,817 --> 00:31:19,861
he's gonna go scot-free.

709
00:31:21,237 --> 00:31:24,146
But that's not why you came here
in the middle of the night.

710
00:31:25,413 --> 00:31:26,394
Is that for me?

711
00:31:26,701 --> 00:31:28,918
Yeah, but...

712
00:31:29,412 --> 00:31:31,520
now I'm not sure
if it's gonna help or hurt.

713
00:31:31,915 --> 00:31:33,144
Try me.

714
00:31:35,481 --> 00:31:38,193
Remember I told you
I had soft intel that suggested

715
00:31:38,217 --> 00:31:40,484
Honaker and Gronsky
were together in Panama?

716
00:31:43,468 --> 00:31:45,367
This is two days
after the bridge collapse

717
00:31:45,391 --> 00:31:47,013
in Panama City.

718
00:31:49,062 --> 00:31:51,574
Oh, my God.

719
00:31:51,598 --> 00:31:53,130
This is great.

720
00:31:55,563 --> 00:31:57,212
This changes everything.

721
00:31:58,126 --> 00:31:59,985
It does, and it doesn't.

722
00:32:01,820 --> 00:32:02,718
I cheated again.

723
00:32:02,742 --> 00:32:05,087
I got that by hacking into an NSA server.

724
00:32:05,969 --> 00:32:07,089
You can't use it.

725
00:32:07,651 --> 00:32:09,062
If you introduce that photo,

726
00:32:09,086 --> 00:32:10,863
I'll be behind bars in a matter of days.

727
00:32:10,887 --> 00:32:12,330
Well, why'd you bring it to me?

728
00:32:13,707 --> 00:32:15,335
I just...

729
00:32:15,359 --> 00:32:17,804
sensed how badly you needed to know.

730
00:32:17,828 --> 00:32:20,130
You were right all along.

731
00:32:20,964 --> 00:32:23,064
I thought it was important.

732
00:32:24,168 --> 00:32:25,593
I'm sorry.

733
00:32:30,579 --> 00:32:32,267
Dr. Bull...

734
00:32:33,560 --> 00:32:34,752
you can't use it.

735
00:32:34,776 --> 00:32:36,356
I understand.

736
00:32:36,380 --> 00:32:37,720
Can I have it, please?

737
00:32:37,744 --> 00:32:39,200
No.

738
00:32:39,224 --> 00:32:41,317
I think you should probably go now.

739
00:32:58,403 --> 00:32:59,914
There's not a day gone by
since the tragedy

740
00:32:59,938 --> 00:33:03,423
when I haven't wondered what
we could have done differently.

741
00:33:04,382 --> 00:33:06,087
And what have you determined? I believe,

742
00:33:06,111 --> 00:33:09,439
we honestly did the best we could.

743
00:33:09,988 --> 00:33:13,473
You know, we handle over a
thousand transactions a second.

744
00:33:14,041 --> 00:33:16,012
The possibility that we might miss

745
00:33:16,036 --> 00:33:18,681
one errant financial anomaly,
one exchange,

746
00:33:18,705 --> 00:33:21,684
though infinitesimally small,

747
00:33:22,192 --> 00:33:25,054
obviously still exists.

748
00:33:25,487 --> 00:33:26,756
And that's no excuse.

749
00:33:27,197 --> 00:33:28,758
We have to do better.

750
00:33:28,782 --> 00:33:30,316
We<i> will</i> do better.

751
00:33:31,034 --> 00:33:32,695
To begin with, we've taken down

752
00:33:32,719 --> 00:33:34,997
Mr. Shaw's code,
and we are in the process

753
00:33:35,021 --> 00:33:38,300
of setting up
far more rigorous protocols.

754
00:33:39,125 --> 00:33:40,653
Thank you, Mr. Honaker.

755
00:33:41,169 --> 00:33:42,989
Nothing further.

756
00:33:43,013 --> 00:33:44,256
Cross-examination?

757
00:33:45,089 --> 00:33:47,048
Yes, Your Honor.

758
00:33:53,014 --> 00:33:54,766
Just to clarify.

759
00:33:55,642 --> 00:33:57,336
It sounds like you're suggesting

760
00:33:57,360 --> 00:34:00,706
that the fault lies not with the bank,

761
00:34:01,064 --> 00:34:03,409
and by extension, not with you,

762
00:34:03,817 --> 00:34:07,947
but with the coding created
for you by the late Adam Shaw.

763
00:34:07,971 --> 00:34:11,117
I take no pleasure
in speaking ill of the dead,

764
00:34:11,141 --> 00:34:13,452
but clearly, his work was flawed.

765
00:34:13,476 --> 00:34:15,054
Aah.

766
00:34:15,078 --> 00:34:16,913
I don't know if I follow that.

767
00:34:17,547 --> 00:34:19,992
I mean, he didn't make the software

768
00:34:20,016 --> 00:34:22,661
that was supposed
to spot the transactions.

769
00:34:22,685 --> 00:34:24,530
The government did that.

770
00:34:24,554 --> 00:34:27,166
He made the software that allowed you

771
00:34:27,190 --> 00:34:28,934
to circumvent the government safeguards.

772
00:34:28,958 --> 00:34:31,604
Objection. Is counsel going
to ask a question,

773
00:34:31,628 --> 00:34:33,239
or simply pontificate for the jury?

774
00:34:33,263 --> 00:34:34,840
I apologize, Your Honor.

775
00:34:34,864 --> 00:34:37,176
And yes, I-I do have a question.

776
00:34:39,169 --> 00:34:41,847
Are you certain
you don't know an Ivan Gronsky,

777
00:34:42,730 --> 00:34:45,317
the terrorist leader
who took down the bridge?

778
00:34:45,775 --> 00:34:48,120
No. I do not.

779
00:34:48,144 --> 00:34:50,645
As I've stated numerous times.

780
00:34:57,921 --> 00:35:02,201
So, if you don't know Ivan Gronsky,

781
00:35:02,226 --> 00:35:04,705
then how do you explain this photo...

782
00:35:04,730 --> 00:35:05,907
Oh, my gosh.

783
00:35:05,932 --> 00:35:07,243
Bull, you can't do that.

784
00:35:07,397 --> 00:35:08,674
...which was

785
00:35:08,698 --> 00:35:11,717
taken in Panama two days

786
00:35:11,741 --> 00:35:14,613
after the I-99 collapsed?

787
00:35:16,364 --> 00:35:18,350
That's you, isn't it,

788
00:35:18,374 --> 00:35:20,886
with Mr. Gronsky,

789
00:35:20,910 --> 00:35:22,555
together,

790
00:35:22,579 --> 00:35:25,024
a week before the CIA and Interpol took

791
00:35:25,048 --> 00:35:26,725
him and the rest of his team out?

792
00:35:26,749 --> 00:35:28,661
Objection! We've never seen this photo.

793
00:35:28,685 --> 00:35:30,329
We have complied with the court order

794
00:35:30,353 --> 00:35:31,597
to turn over our documents.

795
00:35:31,621 --> 00:35:34,366
For the plaintiff to sandbag us like this

796
00:35:34,390 --> 00:35:36,502
is beyond the pale. Counsel, my chambers,

797
00:35:36,526 --> 00:35:37,770
now.

798
00:35:37,794 --> 00:35:38,971
Dr. Bull,

799
00:35:38,995 --> 00:35:40,061
you, too.

800
00:35:41,664 --> 00:35:44,009
There's no foundation
for this photo whatsoever.

801
00:35:44,033 --> 00:35:45,644
It could have been photoshopped.

802
00:35:45,668 --> 00:35:47,947
Okay, then. Mr. Colón,

803
00:35:48,463 --> 00:35:50,249
Dr. Bull,

804
00:35:50,273 --> 00:35:51,650
one of you had better tell me

805
00:35:51,674 --> 00:35:53,741
where this photograph came from now.

806
00:35:56,212 --> 00:35:58,557
It just surfaced this
morning on a small website.

807
00:35:58,581 --> 00:36:00,960
Probably being picked up by all the

808
00:36:00,984 --> 00:36:03,095
major media outlets as we speak.

809
00:36:03,119 --> 00:36:06,232
For all we know, members
of the jury are looking at it

810
00:36:06,256 --> 00:36:08,934
on their phones
while we're back here fighting.

811
00:36:09,359 --> 00:36:10,903
Can't control the media.

812
00:36:11,361 --> 00:36:13,072
As for the veracity of the photograph,

813
00:36:13,096 --> 00:36:14,640
may I suggest, Your Honor,

814
00:36:14,664 --> 00:36:16,275
that since her client is
already on the stand,

815
00:36:16,299 --> 00:36:18,144
why don't we ask him to authenticate it?

816
00:36:18,168 --> 00:36:19,778
He knows whether it's him or not,

817
00:36:19,802 --> 00:36:22,603
and he certainly knows
whether he was there.

818
00:36:25,141 --> 00:36:27,286
You're right. Of course he does.

819
00:36:27,310 --> 00:36:29,355
Let's get back in there.

820
00:36:29,379 --> 00:36:31,257
It's a simple question, sir.

821
00:36:31,281 --> 00:36:33,259
Is that you in the photo or not?

822
00:36:33,283 --> 00:36:36,274
I'd... have to study it to say for sure.

823
00:36:36,298 --> 00:36:38,364
Really? That's what you're going with?

824
00:36:38,388 --> 00:36:39,865
You know what you look like, don't you?

825
00:36:39,889 --> 00:36:40,822
Objection.

826
00:36:40,846 --> 00:36:42,301
Withdrawn.

827
00:36:42,325 --> 00:36:44,470
I'll concede, it looks like me.

828
00:36:44,494 --> 00:36:45,771
Looks like you?

829
00:36:45,795 --> 00:36:47,173
Okay.

830
00:36:47,197 --> 00:36:49,574
All right. All right, we'll go with that.

831
00:36:49,598 --> 00:36:52,878
Uh... let me ask you another question.

832
00:36:52,902 --> 00:36:55,848
Uh, this guy who looks like you?

833
00:36:55,872 --> 00:36:57,550
He looks pretty angry in this picture.

834
00:36:58,408 --> 00:37:00,886
Is it because his terrorist buddy

835
00:37:00,910 --> 00:37:03,789
who'd been limiting his activities

836
00:37:03,813 --> 00:37:07,648
to Eastern Europe
suddenly killed 37 Americans?

837
00:37:09,836 --> 00:37:11,897
I mean, that must have

838
00:37:11,921 --> 00:37:14,567
<i>really</i> turned up the heat
on you and the bank.

839
00:37:15,550 --> 00:37:17,369
I'm sorry.

840
00:37:17,393 --> 00:37:19,946
I mean... the heat

841
00:37:19,970 --> 00:37:22,399
on the guy in this photo

842
00:37:22,423 --> 00:37:24,058
who looks exactly like you.

843
00:37:25,268 --> 00:37:26,561
No answer?

844
00:37:27,270 --> 00:37:28,604
I understand.

845
00:37:29,272 --> 00:37:30,565
It's a lot to digest.

846
00:37:31,341 --> 00:37:33,609
But while you're thinking about it...

847
00:37:35,144 --> 00:37:36,510
let me ask you.

848
00:37:38,072 --> 00:37:41,527
How much did you and the bank
make with Gronsky?

849
00:37:41,551 --> 00:37:43,214
I don't know off-hand.

850
00:37:43,238 --> 00:37:44,700
Well, according to our analysis,

851
00:37:44,724 --> 00:37:47,633
he moved hundreds of millions of
dollars a year through Thoreau.

852
00:37:49,250 --> 00:37:53,172
Funding from foreign
governments, ransoms.

853
00:37:53,629 --> 00:37:56,909
Over the last decade,
over a billion dollars.

854
00:37:56,933 --> 00:37:58,510
Again,

855
00:37:58,534 --> 00:38:00,613
I can't verify those numbers.

856
00:38:00,637 --> 00:38:03,048
What about your year-end bonus
this past year?

857
00:38:03,072 --> 00:38:04,724
Can you verify that?

858
00:38:07,110 --> 00:38:09,121
$80 million.

859
00:38:09,520 --> 00:38:11,624
$80 million.

860
00:38:11,648 --> 00:38:14,150
$80 million. Wow.

861
00:38:14,917 --> 00:38:16,444
Whew!

862
00:38:17,287 --> 00:38:22,201
37 dead Americans
driving over that bridge,

863
00:38:22,225 --> 00:38:25,293
trying to get home to their loved ones.

864
00:38:27,502 --> 00:38:29,435
No further questions, Your Honor.

865
00:38:35,213 --> 00:38:37,085
Has the jury reached a verdict?

866
00:38:37,109 --> 00:38:38,550
We have, Your Honor.

867
00:38:39,342 --> 00:38:42,621
In the above entitled action,
we find for the plaintiff

868
00:38:42,645 --> 00:38:45,848
in the amount of $100 million.

869
00:38:54,482 --> 00:38:59,271
- Thank you.
- Thank you... for letting us do this.

870
00:38:59,295 --> 00:39:00,839
Oh, my God.

871
00:39:00,863 --> 00:39:02,031
We did it.

872
00:39:03,241 --> 00:39:04,743
And you.

873
00:39:04,767 --> 00:39:06,345
You were amazing.

874
00:39:06,369 --> 00:39:07,913
Oh, Cable was.

875
00:39:07,937 --> 00:39:09,448
This was for her.

876
00:39:09,472 --> 00:39:11,405
Yeah.

877
00:39:23,653 --> 00:39:26,222
Hmm. I wish this felt better.

878
00:39:27,657 --> 00:39:29,835
He doesn't look too unhappy.

879
00:39:30,434 --> 00:39:32,395
Pocket change for him.

880
00:39:33,271 --> 00:39:36,942
Just... wait a second.

881
00:39:37,483 --> 00:39:39,266
John Honaker.

882
00:39:41,487 --> 00:39:43,015
You're under arrest

883
00:39:43,039 --> 00:39:46,151
for providing material aid
to terrorists, resulting

884
00:39:46,175 --> 00:39:47,553
in multiple deaths.

885
00:39:52,749 --> 00:39:55,527
You feel better now?

886
00:39:55,551 --> 00:39:59,164
Yeah. I guess I do.

887
00:40:22,912 --> 00:40:27,159
You know, everyone at
TAC still thinks it was me

888
00:40:27,183 --> 00:40:29,845
that slipped that photo to
that anti-banking website.

889
00:40:30,636 --> 00:40:32,050
Girl has to protect herself.

890
00:40:32,496 --> 00:40:34,919
Soon as I realized you weren't
gonna give me the picture back,

891
00:40:34,943 --> 00:40:36,888
I had to come up with a plausible reason

892
00:40:36,912 --> 00:40:38,556
why it was out there.

893
00:40:38,580 --> 00:40:40,425
Classic Homeland move, by the way.

894
00:40:40,449 --> 00:40:43,027
Using a news outlet
to launder a photograph?

895
00:40:43,051 --> 00:40:44,347
Oh.

896
00:40:44,371 --> 00:40:46,598
- I may steal that from you.
- Hmm.

897
00:40:46,622 --> 00:40:48,633
Unless, of course,
you've changed your mind

898
00:40:48,657 --> 00:40:50,401
and want to come work for me,

899
00:40:50,425 --> 00:40:52,626
in which case there'd be no point.

900
00:40:54,150 --> 00:40:57,063
Well... that depends.

901
00:40:58,827 --> 00:41:00,805
If I hadn't done what I did,

902
00:41:00,830 --> 00:41:02,568
would you have sold me out?

903
00:41:03,792 --> 00:41:05,726
Would you have used that photo?

904
00:41:08,897 --> 00:41:10,326
I think you would have.

905
00:41:10,933 --> 00:41:14,735
I think nothing matters more to
you than getting the bad guys.

906
00:41:18,087 --> 00:41:19,335
I'm sorry.

907
00:41:21,037 --> 00:41:22,463
Of course...

908
00:41:22,965 --> 00:41:25,216
this bad guy had done something...

909
00:41:26,161 --> 00:41:28,678
awful to a member of your team.

910
00:41:29,398 --> 00:41:31,180
You were seeking justice for her.

911
00:41:31,834 --> 00:41:33,767
Nothing for yourself.

912
00:41:35,230 --> 00:41:38,464
I'd love to work for someone
who sticks up for me like that.

913
00:41:39,582 --> 00:41:41,274
Excuse me?

914
00:41:43,652 --> 00:41:46,530
I've already discussed money and
benefits and hours with Marissa.

915
00:41:46,555 --> 00:41:48,467
Hours? We don't do hours.

916
00:41:48,492 --> 00:41:50,032
I do.

917
00:41:50,445 --> 00:41:53,391
But I promise you
you and your company will be

918
00:41:53,416 --> 00:41:55,649
the second most important thing
in my life.

919
00:41:57,639 --> 00:41:59,208
Second.

920
00:42:00,128 --> 00:42:02,340
That's all I have to offer,

921
00:42:02,364 --> 00:42:04,130
and I'm offering it to you.

922
00:42:05,256 --> 00:42:06,878
Sold.

923
00:42:06,902 --> 00:42:08,902
Mommy?

924
00:42:09,839 --> 00:42:12,951
I believe you're being
summoned by Number One.

925
00:42:13,575 --> 00:42:16,767
I believe he might have
just<i> done</i> a number two.

926
00:42:17,813 --> 00:42:19,224
See you Monday.

927
00:42:19,248 --> 00:42:21,292
See you Monday.

928
00:42:26,320 --> 00:42:32,520
